#5天学物联网：无线传感器网络（WSN）、IPv6和物联网（IOT）的简单指南

这本书是一个快速但深思熟虑的入门指南，涵盖了重要的主题，如IPv6网络、传感器、无线协议与技术，以及物联网云平台及其最常用的协议，其中包含了许多基础开始工作的实践例子。

课程和例子主要集中在Contiki OS（一种非常适合低功耗嵌入式设备的著名物联网操作系统）和Zolertia Z1 Mote（一种广泛用于开发物联网应用程序的硬件平台）上。也可以用于树莓派。

## 涵盖主题:

- 物联网简介。
- IPv6简介。
- 6LOWPAN介绍。
- Contiki OS、安装、结构和库。
- 模拟和数字传感器。
- 无线和射频基础。
- 多跳网络上的UDP和TCP。
- MQTT，COAP和RESTFull协议。
- 端到端的IPv6应用程序：连接到物联网云平台

## 发行版

A first draft of this book was showcased, and heavily used, in the Workshop on Scientific Applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), hosted at the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in Trieste, Italy, from 16 to 27 March 2015.  The commit of the PDF is available [Here](https://github.com/alignan/IPv6-WSN-book/commit/2de741e412ac11a9b39327385f37957b201c5124).

A Spanish translated version of the "IoT in five days" book, close to the first draft, was used for the "18º Workshop para America Latina y el Caribe" (WALC15), hosted at the CTEC (Centro de Transferencia Tecnologica y de Educacion Continua) and TEC (Tecnologico de Costa Rica) in Costa Rica, from 16-20 November 2015.  A link to the Spanish book is available [Here](http://wireless.ictp.it/Papers/InternetdelasCosas.pdf).

The "IoT in five days" book has also been used in the Internet of Things Summer-Winter summer school 2016, hosted at the UNLP (National University of La Plata), in La Plata, Argentina, from 28 February to 4 March 2016.

A second release, and namely the first official v1.0 release was produced for the Workshop on New Frontiers in Internet of Things, hosted at the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in Trieste, Italy, from 7-18 March 2016.  The PDF, HTML and epub formats are available [Here](https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book/releases/tag/v1.0).

The new v.1.1 release is to be used in the Summer School on IoT, hosted by the CEA-IoT (Centro de Excelencia y Apropiacion en Internet de las Cosas) at the "Pontificia Universidad Javeriana", in Bogota-Colombia, from July 11-16 July 2016.  The PDF, HTML and epub formats are available [Here](https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book/releases/tag/v1.1).
